# SpellChecking-
This process verify that a particular word is spelled properly according to some dictionary. Spell checkers are used in many applications, including word processors (such as Microsoft Word), electronic dictionaries…
Spell checking itself is trivial, requiring only a simple lookup in a dictionary. However, most applications of spell checking also require that the spell checker provide a list of potentially 
correct spellings (“near matches”) when the word was spelled improperly. For instance, if I type 
“speling” into an online dictionary, it will provide suggestions of similar words that I may have 
meant to type, including “spelling”, “spoiling”, “sapling”, and “splendid”.
